# Python mongodump

This is a Docker-compatible Python script to make a dump of a mongo database, puts it in a gzip compressed tarfile, and pushes it to an S3 bucket.

It uses Hashicorp Vault to get the authentication

This is intended to be ran under fargate or a lambda function.

Use lambda if the total database size is less than 256 MB due to disk limitations, otherwise use fargate.

Make sure the lambda or fargate container has IAM access to `s3:PutObject and ses:SendEmail`
